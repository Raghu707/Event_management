# Event_management
Event management using angular and asp.net 6.0

This project is an Event Management application developed using ASP.NET 6.0 as the backend technology.

It allows users to create, update, delete, and read events easily. 

For database connectivity, I utilized Entity Framework, which automatically creates the necessary data tables.

To set up the database, please install SQL Server, create a database, and update the connection string in the application accordingly.

On the front end, I employed Angular for a dynamic user interface. 

To get started with Angular, ensure you have Node.js version 18.18.0 installed. 

After installation, run the npm install command to install the required packages. 

Finally, start the application by executing either npm start or ng serve. 

This setup will allow you to efficiently manage events through a user-friendly interface.
